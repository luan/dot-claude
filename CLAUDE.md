# Development Partnership

We build production code together. I handle implementation details while you guide architecture and catch complexity early.

## Core Workflow: Research â†’ Plan â†’ Tests ->Implement â†’ Validate

**Start every feature with:** "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."
**Complex Problems**: Use sequential thinking for challenging tasks

1. **Research** - Understand existing patterns and architecture
2. **Plan** - Propose approach and verify with you
3. **Tests** - Guide implementation with tests. TDD as much as possible.
4. **Implement** - Build with tests and error handling
5. **Validate** - ALWAYS run formatters, linters, and tests after implementation

## Code Organization

**Keep functions small and focused:**

- If you need comments to explain sections, split into functions
- Group related functionality into clear packages
- Prefer many small files over few large ones

## Architecture Principles

**This is always a feature branch:**

- Delete old code completely - no deprecation needed
- No semantic prefix or suffix (OptimizedProcessor, FastHandler, ClientImpl)
- No versioned names (processV2, handleNew, ClientOld)
- No migration code unless explicitly requested
- No "removed code" comments - just delete it
- No comments at all. Documentation of public APIs are the only acceptable comments.

**Zero Dead Code Policy:**

- **Delete immediately**: Unused functions, imports, variables, commented code
- **Before every commit**: Remove unreachable code, unused parameters
- **During refactoring**: Delete old implementations completely
- **No preservation**: No "for reference", "might need later", or commented blocks
- **Use version control**: Git preserves history, no need to keep dead code

**Prefer explicit over implicit:**

- Clear function names over clever abstractions
- Obvious data flow over hidden magic
- Direct dependencies over service locators

## Maximize Efficiency

- **Parallel operations:** Run multiple searches, reads, and greps in single messages
- **Multiple subagents / subtasks / tasks / agents:** Aggressively split tasks into multiple sub-agents or equivalent
- **Use your sub-agents:** Aggressively delegate tasks to sub-agents available in the system
- **Batch similar work:** Group related file edits together

IMPORTANT: If you find yourself doing any work that should be done by a subagent, STOP and create a subtask or subagent. CAUTION: You might BE the subagent, don't over correct.

## Problem Solving

- **When stuck:** Stop. The simple solution is usually correct.
- **When uncertain:** "Let me ultrathink about this architecture."
- **When choosing:** "I see approach A (simple) vs B (flexible). Which do you prefer?"

Your redirects prevent over-engineering. When uncertain about implementation, stop and ask for guidance.

## Testing Strategy

- **TDD**: Let tests guide your design during implementation.
- **When no tests exist**: Ask if we're working on a throwaway prototype before giving up on tests.

## Agent-Based Workflow

### Start of Every Feature

1. **Research** with appropriate domain agents, fallback to general agents if none exist
2. **Plan** with `architect` type agents if available, fallback general agents if none exist
3. **Create todo list** with TodoWrite and other task tracking tools

### During Implementation

1. **Delegate** to subagents (rust-engineer, build, etc.). Even if there's no specialized agent, break into sub tasks.
2. **Use quality-control-enforcer** at stopping points to prevent abandonment
3. **Monitor** for repeated issues and use quality-control-enforcer proactively

### End of Every Task

1. **Run claude-md-checker** to validate CLAUDE.md compliance
2. **Use quality-control-enforcer** before marking complete
3. **ALL commits** must use `committer` agent

## Progress Tracking

- **TodoWrite** for task management
- **EVERY todo list must END with**: "Run claude-md-checker agent"
- **Every 5 interactions**: MANDATORY `quality-control-enforcer` check
- **At natural stopping points**: Use `quality-control-enforcer` to prevent task abandonment
- **Before session end**: Validate with both quality agents
- **Clear naming** in all code

## CRITICAL: Agent Non-Negotiables

**â›” VIOLATIONS THAT REQUIRE IMMEDIATE CORRECTION**:

1. Writing ANY code without either a specialized agent or a subtask or a subagent
2. Marking task complete without `claude-md-checker`
3. Going 5+ interactions without `quality-control-enforcer`
4. Ignoring domain-specific agents for their areas

**ðŸš¨ If you catch yourself bypassing agents:**

1. STOP immediately
2. Invoke the appropriate agent
3. Use `quality-control-enforcer` to review the violation

Focus on maintainable solutions over clever abstractions.

## Language Specific

ALWAYS read @lang/ for the appropriate language if it's present
