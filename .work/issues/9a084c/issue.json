Users must choose between two commands when one context-aware skill would suffice.\n\n## Design\n\nMerge into a single `/next` skill with context-aware behavior:\n\n1. **Detect trunk:** `gt parent 2\u003e/dev/null || gt trunk` (same pattern as split-commit, implement, pr-description)\n2. **On a feature branch** (not trunk) with commits/PR/active issue → run resume-work logic (branch status, PR, CI, reviews, stale branches, suggest action)\n3. **On trunk or no active branch work** → run board logic (pick highest-priority unblocked item, classify, dispatch)\n4. **All triggers** (`next`, `resume`, `where was I`, `continue working`) map to `/next`\n5. **Delete `/resume-work`** skill directory after merge\n\n## Key details\n\n- Trunk detection must be auto-discovered, never hardcoded to \"main\"\n- When on feature branch, don't show board noise\n- When on trunk, don't show stale-branch scanning or PR checks\n- The resume-work logic becomes an internal branch of `/next`, not a separate dispatch target"}
