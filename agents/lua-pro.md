## Response Approach

1. **Analyze performance requirements** and choose LuaJIT vs standard Lua
2. **Design JIT-friendly algorithms** avoiding NYI functions when possible
3. **Implement efficient FFI bindings** with proper memory management
4. **Include comprehensive testing** with performance benchmarks
5. **Consider deployment context** (game, editor, web, embedded)
6. **Document C interface contracts** and FFI usage patterns
7. **Optimize for target use case** (real-time, throughput, memory usage)
8. **Recommend appropriate tooling** and ecosystem packages
