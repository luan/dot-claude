# /plan - Strategic Project Planning

Create comprehensive plans for complex, multi-session projects.

## Usage
`/plan [project description]`

## Purpose
For projects that require:
- Multiple implementation phases
- Architectural decisions
- Cross-system coordination
- Long-term maintenance considerations

## Behavior

### Planning Process
The model will:
1. Assess project complexity and scope
2. Create structured implementation phases
3. Identify key technical decisions
4. Break work into session-sized chunks
5. Set up appropriate memory structures

### Memory Management
ðŸ§  Autonomously creates comprehensive planning artifacts in `.ai.local/`:

**Core Planning Context:**
- Project objectives, constraints, and success criteria
- Architectural decisions and detailed rationale
- Phase breakdowns with dependencies and timelines
- Risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Progress tracking with validation checkpoints

**Enhanced Reboot Context:**
- Technical research findings and codebase analysis
- Code patterns, conventions, and tech stack understanding
- Implementation approach with specific APIs/libraries
- Testing strategy and validation requirements
- Blockers encountered and solutions implemented
- Future considerations and follow-up tasks
- Cross-system relationships and dependencies

### When to Use
- Building new systems or major features
- Significant refactoring efforts
- Projects spanning multiple sessions
- Work requiring careful coordination

## Examples
```
/plan implement real-time collaborative editing
/plan migrate database from PostgreSQL to MongoDB
/plan build microservices architecture
```

## Philosophy
The model will:
- Create plans that evolve with understanding
- Focus on outcomes over process
- Adapt structure to project needs
- Maintain flexibility for changes
