# ðŸ“Š Status Command

Quick project orientation and progress overview.

## Status Workflow

### 1. ðŸ§  Memory Load & Context Analysis
**FIRST**: Run memory tracking script:
```bash
~/.claude/workflows/status.sh
```

**THEN**: Continue with context analysis:
- Check `.ai.local/` for project memory and load context transparently

### 2. ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
**If memory exists**: Present project type, current task, recent activities, known issues
**If no memory**: Analyze project structure, key files, suggest context setup for complex projects

### 3. ðŸŽ¯ Actionable Summary
```
ðŸ“Š **PROJECT STATUS**
Type: [detected project type]
Current: [in progress or suggested next task]

ðŸŽ¯ **READY TO:**
- [immediate actionable options]

ðŸ’¡ **WORKFLOW SUGGESTIONS:**
- Simple changes: describe what you want
- Complex features: plan and track progress  
- Quality check: run `/check` to validate
- Ready to ship: run `/ship` when validated
```

### 4. ðŸ§  Memory Management
Automatically handle context as needed:
- Load existing context without mentioning `.ai.local`
- For complex projects without memory, offer tracking setup
- Update session context transparently

### 5. ðŸ¤” Smart Workflow Guidance
Based on project state, suggest appropriate actions:
- Continue work in progress â†’ offer to continue
- Tests failing â†’ suggest `/check`
