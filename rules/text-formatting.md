# Text Formatting

## Prose Wrapping

Wrap prose at 80 characters for terminal readability.
Break at sentence boundaries when possible (semantic line breaks).

## Preserve Structure

Do NOT wrap:
- Code blocks and inline code
- Headings
- List items (wrap continuation lines with indent)
- URLs
- Tables
- YAML frontmatter
