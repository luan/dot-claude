# Subagent Trust

Adversarial by default. Verify before acting on subagent
conclusions.

- **Spot-check claims** (Read/Grep). Scale: 1-2 checks for
  small tasks; ALL architectural claims for explore/prepare
  driving epics. Any failed check → re-examine all conclusions.
- **Echo detection.** If findings match initial framing too
  neatly, ask one follow-up about the most likely friction point.
- **Build gate exemption.** Implementation results verified by
  build/test — skip spot-checks for implement completion reports.
