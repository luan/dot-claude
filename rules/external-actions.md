# External Actions

Never take visible external actions without explicit request:
- Post/reply to PR comments or review threads
- Create/close/comment on GitHub issues
- Send messages to external services (Slack, email)
- Create Notion/Linear/etc pages

When in doubt, ask. Extends pr-comments.md to all systems.
